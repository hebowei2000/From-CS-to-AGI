 A collection of classical computer science books including computer organization, computer system ,compilers and parallel programming and advanced materials about deep reinforcement learning, statistical machine learning and non-convex optimization. This repository includes top-level graduate reinforcement learning teching materials given by world-class machine learning researchers. Thank should be given to these greate open-source scientists. In the directories like 'from machine learning to optimization and statistical machine learning' and 'from machine learning to reinforcement learning', i also give the packages of reinforcement learning papers according to most advanced RL research topics. I will update this project continously. Hope more talents join in reinforcement learning community. I believe that artificial general intelligence is not far away from us.
